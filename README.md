# Telecom Network Dashboard

## Overview
The **Telecom Network Dashboard** is a responsive web application designed to visualize key telecommunications metrics using interactive charts. This project showcases my front-end development skills and my ability to integrate third-party libraries while drawing on my background in telecommunications. The dashboard simulates monthly data for:

- **Call Volume:** A bar chart representing the number of calls per month.
- **Call Drop Rate:** A line chart displaying the percentage of dropped calls each month.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Charts:** Utilizes [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to create dynamic and visually appealing charts.
- **Data Simulation:** Generates random data to simulate real-world telecommunications metrics.
- **Modern Web Technologies:** Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - Structure of the web application.
- **CSS3** - Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** - Functionality, data simulation, and chart initialization.
- **[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)** - Library for creating interactive charts.
